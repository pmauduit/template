Template configuration for geOrchestra: fork me !

This configuration folder contains:
 * a ```build_support``` directory hosting:
   * a ```shared.maven.filters``` file, which lists most of the shared maven filters you want to customize for your own setup,
   * a ```GenerateConfig.groovy``` file, which is used to customize the application specific default maven filters,
 * several directories matching the names of geOrchestra modules, whose files will override the default ones in the webapp,
 * a ```DeployScript.groovy``` file, which may optionally be used to automate the deployment of geOrchestra artifacts into tomcat.
 
Please refer to the [main configuration instructions](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/master/config/README.md) if you want to know more about the configuration process in geOrchestra.
